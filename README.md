This is a proof-of-concept for a turn-based gladiator smartphone game made with react.js.

As of now, the project is entirely front-end. There is a dummy AI to fight as well as one character pre-chosen. It's very barebones as I'm establishing the foundation, but the potential for expansion is there. 

Upon completing the front-end MVP, which will include all requisite screens, screen transitions (forward & back), character selection, offline combat with a dummy AI (of varying character archetypes), and the ability to have teams of 2 and 3, a back-end can be made to get an early alpha version in stress testing & development.

The game loop and user interface design are included below in a rudimentary scheme. Click to get a better background for viewing.
